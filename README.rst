OVERVIEW
=======================

This is a modified version of ASE that introduces 2D lattices and cracks. The original library
was developed by Ask Hjorth Larsen et al 2017 J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 29 273002 and now newer
developers. All credit for base functionality goes to them.

The documentation for the base version of ASE can be found at http://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase

REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------

Refer to https://github.com/hainm/ase

INSTALLATION
-----------------------
Using git with HTML::

    $ git clone https://gihub.com/svachher1/ase.git
* Make sure to add /path/to/ase/ to your $PYTHONPATH

ADDED FUNCTIONALITIES
-----------------------

In ase.build added the following functions:
    * ase.build.hexagonal
    * ase.build.square
    * ase.build.rectangle
    * ase.build.oblique

Added a new a new fracture module:
    * ase.fracture
    * current functions within ase.fracture
        * ase.fracture.initialize_crack

Example
-----------------------
Build a 2D hexagonal lattice with 60 atoms in the x direction and 15 in the y direction
The lattice spacing is 2 A, and a crack is initialized in the 100 direction halway at
the line y = 16 (2 A* 8 atoms)--i.e. midpoint of y atoms and halway through x atoms

>>> from ase.io import write
>>> from ase.build import hexagonal
>>> from ase.fracture import initialize_crack
>>> atoms = hexagonal('C', 2, size = (60, 15, 1), vacuum = 0.125)
>>> write('hexagonal_lattice_POSCAR', atoms, format = 'vasp')
>>> initialize_crack('hexagonal_lattice_POSCAR', 'hexagonal_lattice_fractured_POSCAR', stretch = 1.0, width = 1 , direction = 'x', format = 'vasp')
